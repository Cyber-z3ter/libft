# libft

##Description:

This repository contains the libft project, which is an individual implementation of essential standard C library functions. The goal of this project is to create a personal library of re-implemented functions to deepen understanding and proficiency in C programming and low-level manipulation of data.

##Key Features:

Custom implementations of standard functions such as memset, memcpy, strlen, strcpy, strdup, atoi, and more.
A thorough set of documented and tested functions following the requirements outlined by 42 school or personal project specifications.
Comprehensive Makefile for easy compilation and management of the library.
Detailed comments and documentation within the code to explain the logic behind each function.
##Purpose:

Serve as a foundational project in the 42 school curriculum or for individual learning purposes.
Enhance understanding of memory allocation, string manipulation, and other fundamental operations in C programming.
Develop proficiency in writing efficient and robust code while following specific requirements and guidelines.
##Usage:

Clone the repository and compile the library using the provided Makefile.
Include libft.a in your C projects to access custom implementations of standard functions instead of the standard C library functions.
##Note:

This repository is meant for educational and learning purposes.
Contributions or improvements to the library are welcome.
